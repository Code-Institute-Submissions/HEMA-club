# Iron Forged HEMA Club

This project is to promote a mock HEMA (Historical European Martial Arts) club.
The webpage will serve both potiental members and current members.
The overall goal of this website is to promote HEMA interest and provide information about the club.

## UX

There would typically be 3 types of users visiting this site.

User A:

- A current member who wants to view club news, potiental new courses offered by the club or to be redirected to social channels.
- User A can achieve these goal through the nav links on all pages of the site.

User B:

- A user wanting to join this club.
- User B can achieve this goal on any page from the "Sign Up" nav link, then filling out and sending in the Sign Up form.

User C:

- A user interested in HEMA and wants to know more about HEMA-clubs.
- User C can achieve this goal from information found on the Home, Courses and FAQ pages.

This project attempts to cater to all three user types in helping the user achieve their goals quickly with a clean navigation bar and a non-linear narrative.

## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

- Home - A home page with a brief descrition of the club and what HEMA is about.
- News - A page for the club to post news about the club.
- Courses - A page to browse through the different courses offered by the club.
- FAQ - A page with answers to frequently asked questions.
- "Sign Up" form page - A page to send contact information to the club to be contacted about the user's specifed course(s) and sign up for the courses. Currently this form does not send information anywhere.

### Features Left to Implement

- Scheduale/Calender for events and courses.
- A page with information and links to HEMA tournaments.
- A gallery with pictures and videos from the club.
- A information page about the current instructors.

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Bootstrap 4.4 https://getbootstrap.com/ - Used to help structure the grid of the websites. Used also for the navigation bar and accordian styled information in courses.html.
- Font Awesome https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery - Used to add icons to the websites.
- Google Fonts https://fonts.google.com/

## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
   1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
   2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
   3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
   4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
