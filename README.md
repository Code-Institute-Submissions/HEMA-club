# HEMA Club

This project is to promote a mock HEMA (Historical European Martial Arts) club.
The webpage will serve both potiental members and current members.
The overall goal of this website is to promote HEMA intrest and provide information about the club.
 
## UX
 
There would typically be 3 types of users visiting this site.
User A  - A current member who wants to view club news, pictures, competitions, or be redirected to social channels.
        - User A can achieve these goal through the nav links on all pages of the site. 

User B  - A user wanting to join this club. Perhaps this user was refered to this site by a friend or event.
        - User B can achieve this goal on any page with the sign up button.

User C  - A user interested in HEMA and wants to know more about HEMA-clubs.
        - User C can achieve this goal from information found on the Home and HEMA-history pages.

This project attempts to cater to all three user types in helping the user achieve their goals quickly with a clean navigation bar and a non-linear narrative.

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Bootstrap 4.4
- Font Awesome
- Hover.css



## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
